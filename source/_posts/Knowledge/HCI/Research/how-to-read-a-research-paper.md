Based on the [guideline](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf) made by S. Keshav in Stanford University, a effective way on reading paper is by this three-pass approach:

|                 | Description                                                               | Estimated Time                                | Outcome                                                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The first pass  | Quick scan to get a bird's-eye view of the paper.                         | 5 - 10 minutes                                | Have a basic overview of the paper and choose if read further.                         |
| The second pass | Read the paper with greater care, but  <br>ignore details such as proofs. | Up to 1 hour                                  | Grasp the content of the paper with supporting evidence.                               |
| The third pass  | Making the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work.           | 4 - 5 hours for beginners, 1 hour for experts | Identify not only a paper’s innovations, but also its hidden failings and assumptions. |

;;;pass Pass 1st

The first pass is a **quick scan** to get a bird’s-eye view of the paper. You can also decide **whether you need to do any more passes**.

**Estimated Time:** 5 - 10 minutes

**Steps:**

[Step 1]{.label .info} **Carefully** read the ==title==, ==abstract==, and ==introduction==
[Step 2]{.label .info} Read the ==section and sub-section headings==, but ignore everything else
[Step 3]{.label .info} Read the ==conclusion==
[Step 4]{.label .info} **Glance** over the ==references==, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read

**Outcomes**:

At the end of the first pass, you should be able to answer:

1. **Category**: What *type* of paper is this?
2. **Context**: Which *other papers* is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
3. **Correctness**: Do the assumptions appear to be *valid*?
4. **Contributions**: What are the paper's *main contributions*?
5. **Clarity**: Is the paper *well written*?

+++ 10 main HCI paper categories (generated by ChatGPT)
- **Measurement Papers** - These are all about metrics, gathering data, and crunching numbers to measure effectiveness, usability, performance, whatever. Basically, nerd stats central.

- **System Analysis Papers** - Here, they pick apart existing systems, see what's working, what's trash, and where things could be better. It's like a critique but with charts and jargon.

- **Research Prototype Descriptions** - They talk about their shiny new prototype, explaining how it works and maybe hinting it's the future of tech. Spoiler: half the time it isn’t. 

- **Empirical Studies** - Think lab coats and observing how users interact with stuff. They gather real-world data and make big claims based on it.

- **Theoretical or Conceptual Frameworks** - The “thinky” papers where they don’t have data or a prototype, just a lot of ideas on how we *should* be looking at human-computer interaction.

- **Design Case Studies** - Showing off their design process in detail, like, “look what we did and why we did it.” 

- **Methodological Papers** - These focus on new methods or improvements on how research should be done in HCI.

- **Technology Acceptance & Adoption Studies** - They look at how people are accepting new tech or if they’re just ignoring it and why.

- **Toolkits and Libraries** - Papers about frameworks, libraries, or toolkits they’ve developed to make everyone else’s HCI research easier. 

- **Vision Papers** - These are just people dreaming, really—future directions, what HCI might look like in 50 years. Half prediction, half sci-fi.

;;;pass Pass 2nd

In the second pass, read the paper with **greater care**, but **ignore details** such as proofs. It helps to jot down the key points, or to make comments in the margins, as you read.

**Estimated Time**: Up to 1 hour

**Steps:**

Look carefully at the ==figures==, ==diagrams== and other ==illustrations== in the paper. Pay special attention to ==graphs==.	
- Are the axes *properly labeled*?
- Are results shown with error bars, so that *conclusion* are *statistically significant*?
Common mistakes like these will separate rushed, shoddy work from the truly excellent.

:::info Tips 
Remember to **mark relevant unread references** for further reading (this is a good way to learn more about the background of the paper).
:::

**Outcomes**:

At the end of the second pass, you should be able to: 
- **summarize** the main thrust of the paper, with **supporting evidence**, to someone else.

You can now choose to:
- Set the paper aside (Maybe the paper was poorly written, or you don't need to understand the material to be successful)
- Return to the paper later
- Persevere and go on to the third pass

;;;pass  Pass 3rd

The key to the third pass is to **attempt to virtually re-implement the paper**: that is, making the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work. By comparing this re-creation with the actual paper, you can easily identify not only a paper’s innovations, but also its hidden failings and assumptions.

**Estimated Time:** 4 - 5 hours for beginners, 1 hour for experts

**Steps**:

- Identify and ==challenge every assumption in every statement==
- think about ==how you yourself would present a particular idea==

**Outcomes**:

At the end of this pass, you should be able to:
- *Reconstruct* the entire structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to identify its strong and weak points. 
- Pinpoint implicit *assumptions*, *missing citations* to relevant work, and *potential issues* with experimental or analytical techniques.
