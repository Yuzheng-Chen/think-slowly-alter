Based on the [guideline](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf) made by S. Keshav in Stanford University, a effective way on reading paper is by this three-pass approach:

|                 | Description                                                               | Estimated Time                                | Outcome                                                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The first pass  | Quick scan to get a bird's-eye view of the paper.                         | 5 - 10 minutes                                | Have a basic overview of the paper and choose if read further.                         |
| The second pass | Read the paper with greater care, but  <br>ignore details such as proofs. | Up to 1 hour                                  | Grasp the content of the paper with supporting evidence.                               |
| The third pass  | Making the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work.           | 4 - 5 hours for beginners, 1 hour for experts | Identify not only a paperâ€™s innovations, but also its hidden failings and assumptions. |
