## Chapter 1: The Pig Farm in the Mist

The air was heavy with mist, thick as a veil, saturating the sky and earth alike. The fog swirled around me, carrying the damp scent of earth and iron, as I found myself walking through my father’s pig farm. The farm seemed to stretch forever, enclosed by a massive iron fence that looped around the muddy ground. It was the sort of place I’d known all my life, but now, in this dream, it felt strange, unfamiliar. I wasn’t alone—beside me walked a woman I’d never met before, her face partially obscured by the fog. I couldn’t remember her name or how we’d come to walk together, but there was something calming about her presence.

We wandered aimlessly, our steps slow and deliberate, as though neither of us wanted to disturb the quiet. Occasionally, a shadowy figure of a pig would materialize out of the mist, but then it would disappear just as quickly, lost to the shrouded world around us.

The fence at the perimeter of the farm was tall, the bars thick with rust. Through the gaps, I could barely make out what lay beyond—the fog was too dense, making everything outside appear as a vague blur of whites and grays. It was as if the world outside the farm had ceased to exist.

I stopped walking and turned to the woman. “What’s out there?” I asked, though I wasn’t sure if I meant the world outside or something more abstract—like what lay beyond this moment, this fog.

She shrugged, her face expressionless. “Let’s go see,” she replied softly, her voice almost lost in the mist.

We walked toward the far end of the farm, and as we did, the fog seemed to press closer, heavy and suffocating. The fence marked the border of this place, solid and imposing, but as we approached, I noticed a small hole at its base—just large enough for one of us to crawl through. It was strange how neither of us had noticed it before.

“Should we go through?” I asked, already crouching down to examine it more closely. The hole looked like it had been made recently, almost as if someone wanted us to find it.

“Why not?” she said, a small smile tugging at the corners of her lips. Her face was clearer now, though still shadowed by the mist.

We both knelt down, squeezing through the narrow gap, one after the other. The metal was cold and rough against my skin, but the moment we passed through, the air on the other side felt different—lighter, freer. There was no turning back now.

## Chapter 2: The Infinite White Wilderness

As soon as we emerged on the other side of the fence, the fog seemed to lift slightly, revealing an expanse of barren land stretching in every direction. The ground beneath our feet was hard-packed dirt, its surface broken only by cracks and the occasional tuft of dry grass. It felt as though we had crossed into another world—one that was both familiar and foreign.

The woman and I continued to walk, moving further and further away from the pig farm, its form quickly disappearing into the fog behind us. The sky above was a dull, oppressive gray, the kind of color that made it impossible to tell what time of day it was. Despite the lack of landmarks, we kept walking. There was no conversation between us, only the steady rhythm of our footsteps and the occasional soft crunch of dirt beneath our shoes.

Every now and then, I thought I saw shapes in the mist—strange, indistinct figures that flickered in and out of view. At first, I dismissed them as tricks of the light, but the further we walked, the more frequent these shapes became. Sometimes they looked like animals—other times, they seemed human. Yet whenever I tried to get a closer look, they would fade away, swallowed by the whiteness around us.

The silence between us grew heavier, though it wasn’t uncomfortable. It felt as if the world itself was waiting—waiting for something to happen, for something to change. But as we walked, nothing did. The land stretched on endlessly, and I began to wonder if we were moving at all, or if the world was simply rearranging itself around us, trapping us in a loop.

The mist thinned further as the hours wore on, and just when I thought the emptiness would continue forever, I saw a faint glow on the horizon. It flickered like a distant candle, soft and inviting, though it seemed impossibly far away.

“Do you see that?” I asked, pointing to the faint light.

The woman nodded, her eyes fixed on the distant glow. “A city,” she murmured. “Maybe we can find something there.”

With renewed purpose, we began to move faster, our steps quickening as we made our way toward the light. But as we walked, the day began to fade, and the fog finally dissipated, replaced by the coolness of evening. The city, now more visible, was shrouded in shadows, its buildings towering but somehow indistinct.

## Chapter 3: The City in Shadows

By the time we reached the city, the sun had long since set, and the only light came from the dim, flickering streetlamps that lined the empty roads. The buildings were old, their facades cracked and worn, with many windows darkened as though the inhabitants had long since abandoned them. There was an eerie stillness to the place, the kind of quiet that made me feel as though we were the only ones left in the world.

We walked through the narrow streets, the yellowish glow of the lamps casting long shadows that stretched out behind us. Occasionally, I caught glimpses of movement in the corner of my eye—a curtain shifting in a window, the faint creak of a door closing—but when I turned to look, there was nothing there. The city felt alive, but it was an unsettling kind of life, as if the place itself was watching us.

“This place…” I trailed off, unsure of how to describe the sensation.

“It’s waiting,” the woman said, her voice barely above a whisper. “For us.”

We continued walking, the sound of our footsteps echoing down the narrow, crooked streets. In the distance, I could see the faint neon glow of a tall building—a skyscraper, its lights blinking in the darkness. It seemed out of place amidst the decaying cityscape, almost too bright, too modern compared to the rest of the surroundings.

“I think that’s where we need to go,” I said, pointing toward the distant building. “It looks like a mall or something.”

“Let’s head there, then,” she replied, though her voice lacked the certainty it once had.

But no matter how long we walked, the building never seemed to get any closer. It loomed in the distance like a mirage, teasing us with its brightness but always staying just beyond our reach. The city streets twisted and turned in nonsensical ways, doubling back on themselves, leading us in circles. I began to feel as though the city was deliberately keeping us from reaching our destination, like it didn’t want us to leave.

Frustration gnawed at me, but I didn’t voice it. Instead, I glanced at the woman, her face unreadable in the dim light. She hadn’t said anything for a while now, her focus entirely on the road ahead.

After what felt like hours of walking, I slowed my pace, my legs growing heavy with fatigue. “Maybe we should stop for the night,” I suggested. “We can find a place to stay and try again tomorrow.”

She nodded in agreement, and we began to search for somewhere to rest.

## Chapter 4: The Flickering World

The motel we found was small and tucked away on a side street, barely visible between the shadows of taller buildings. It looked old, but it was clean enough, and I was too tired to care about the details. We stepped inside, and the receptionist handed us a key with a faint smile, her eyes dull and indifferent. She didn’t ask us any questions, and we didn’t offer any explanations.

The room itself was modest—a single large bed, a wooden desk with a chair, and an old computer sitting on top of it. There was a window, but the curtains were drawn, and I had no desire to look outside. The room felt safe, in a way that was both comforting and unsettling.

I dropped my bag onto the bed and walked over to the computer. Something about it drew me in, its old, boxy frame sparking a sense of nostalgia deep within me. I turned it on, and to my surprise, it booted up quickly, its screen flickering to life with an old game I hadn’t played since childhood.

The game’s world was strange, made up of floating platforms suspended in a void of endless black. It was a game my brother and I used to play, though I couldn’t remember all the details. As I clicked through the menus and began to explore the digital landscape, I felt a strange mixture of joy and sadness—joy for the memories it stirred, and sadness for the time that had passed.

But as I played, the game felt wrong. The platforms were too fragile, the world too small. It was as if I were trapped in a box, with no way to escape. The thin walls of the game world were suffocating, and the more I played, the more I felt the weight of those walls pressing in on me.

I stopped playing and turned off the computer, sitting back in the chair with a heavy sigh. The woman was lying on the bed, watching me with a faint smile.

“You miss it, don’t you?” she asked.

“Miss what?” I replied, though I knew exactly what she

 meant.

“The way things used to be,” she said softly. “Before everything changed.”

I didn’t answer. Instead, I picked up my phone and glanced at the time. It was late—past eleven. I should’ve called my parents, told them where I was, but something stopped me. I typed out a message to my mother, my fingers hovering over the screen, but then, just as quickly, I deleted it.

“I’ll deal with it tomorrow,” I muttered, more to myself than to her.

The woman didn’t respond, and I climbed into bed beside her, pulling the blankets up around me. My thoughts were jumbled, filled with fragments of the day and memories I hadn’t touched in years. I wanted to keep walking, to see where the road would lead, but there was also the weight of responsibility—the looming exam, the real world I had left behind.

“I have a test tomorrow,” I said, my voice barely a whisper.

“I’ll take you there,” she replied, her voice calm and soothing. “In the morning.”

And with that, I closed my eyes, letting the world fade away.

## Chapter 5: The Message Undone

When I woke, the room was bathed in soft morning light, the heavy shadows of the night replaced by a quiet stillness. The woman was already up, standing by the window with her back to me. She looked out into the city, though I couldn’t tell what she was seeing.

I rubbed my eyes, feeling groggy and disoriented. For a moment, I had forgotten where I was, but the memories of the previous night slowly came flooding back. The fog, the endless walk, the strange, shifting city—it all felt like a distant dream, though I knew it had been real.

The clock on the wall ticked quietly, and I glanced at my phone. It was already past six. My exam was in an hour.

“I need to go,” I said, sitting up and swinging my legs over the side of the bed.

The woman turned to face me, her expression unreadable. “I’ll take you,” she said again, her voice steady. “We’ll make it in time.”

I nodded, though a part of me wondered if I really wanted to go. There was something about this world, this dreamlike city, that made me hesitate. It felt like I had stumbled into a place where time didn’t matter, where the rules of reality didn’t apply. And yet, the pull of the real world was strong—my responsibilities, my obligations—they weighed on me, pulling me back toward the familiar.

We left the motel and stepped out into the street. The city had changed again—its buildings more solid, its streets more defined. The fog was gone, replaced by a clear, pale sky. It felt like the dream was fading, like the world was becoming more real.

We walked in silence, the air cool and crisp. As we approached the edge of the city, I felt a strange sense of finality, as if this journey was coming to an end.

The woman stopped suddenly, turning to face me. “Do you want to go back?” she asked, her voice soft but piercing.

I hesitated, the weight of her question sinking into me. Did I want to return to the real world? Or did I want to stay in this strange, shifting place, where nothing was certain and anything was possible?

I looked at her, and for the first time, I realized that I didn’t know what lay behind her calm exterior. She had been my guide, my companion, but now I wondered if she was something more—something deeper, more mysterious. Was she a part of this world, or had she come from somewhere else?

“I don’t know,” I whispered.

She smiled, but it was a sad smile, as if she already knew the answer. “You’ll find your way,” she said, stepping aside to let me pass.

I took a deep breath and walked forward, leaving her behind. The city faded from view, and soon, the real world came rushing back.

## Chapter 6: Awakening

I woke up to the sound of my alarm buzzing next to my bed. The morning sun streamed through the window, casting long shadows across the room. For a moment, I lay there, staring at the ceiling, my mind still tangled in the remnants of the dream.

The test was today. I had to get up, get ready, go back to my routine. But something inside me had changed. The dream had left a mark, something subtle but undeniable.

I got out of bed and looked out the window. The world outside was bright and clear, but in the back of my mind, I could still see the fog, the endless city streets, the flickering lights in the distance.

And the woman—I could still feel her presence, lingering like a shadow, just out of reach.

As I dressed and prepared to leave, I couldn’t help but wonder: had it all been a dream? Or had I truly glimpsed something beyond the ordinary, something that would stay with me, no matter where I went?

With a final glance in the mirror, I grabbed my bag and headed out the door, ready to face the day. But as I walked, I knew that the journey was far from over. The fog might have lifted, but the questions remained.

And somewhere, deep within me, I knew I would return to that world again—someday.
